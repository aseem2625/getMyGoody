# getMyGoody
Checks status of your product you want to purchase online and emails you when it is available.

#Description
- Script to check if your product of choice is available in stocks again!
Just run the script and sit back and wait for an email(gmail). Just turn on desktop notifications.


#Steps to make it work:
- npm i
- node script.js
- Get your application specific password from gmail https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833
It's good to have application specific password instead of using your actual gmail password. 
But the same is compulsory if you've enabled 2-step verification in your gmail.
- Copy the url from the page where your product is listed and paste in the location in code.
- modify the jquery condition for that specific website.
- VOILA, that's easy.


#Why?
I want to see Oneplus 3 through the VR headset that is available for free at oneplus website. 
But since it's free, it gets out of stock of very soon and checking manually when it is available
is not something that a technical person should do.
